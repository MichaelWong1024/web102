## Notes

Challenges:
1. As the complexity of the application increased with each new feature, it became challenging to keep track of existing functionalities and avoid reinventing the wheel.
2. Ensuring consistency and integration among various components required careful management and frequent revisiting of earlier code.
3. Adapting to the event-driven nature of web development was a bit tricky. Learning how to handle and react to user actions, like clicks and searches, needed a different way of thinking about programming.
